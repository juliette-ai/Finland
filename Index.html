        <li>Winter lasts 5 months In Helsinki</li>
        <li>Finnish cuisine is notable for generally combining traditional country fare and haute cuisine with contemporary continental style cooking</li>
        <li> Helsinki is the most expensive city, while Laaperanta, Pori and Tampere are known as the most affordable student cities</li>
        <p><strong>Helsinki is the main point of entry for most visitors to Finland. </strong><br>The busy Baltic port is where you'll find the most important museums, as well as architecture by some of the greatest Finnish architects, especially Eliel Saarinen, who designed Helsinki's Railway Station, a landmark of early modern architecture. Within easy reach of Helsinki are the charming smaller cities of Turku and Porvoo. But it would be a shame to confine a trip only to the Baltic coast, when so much beautiful open countryside beckons. <br>To the west lie the Finnish lakes, and in the north is the vast area beyond the Arctic Circle, home of the midnight sun, northern lights, and some of Europe's best winter sports. Winter or summer, Finland offers plenty of things to see and do. Plan your trip with our list of the top attractions and places to visit in Finland.</p>
